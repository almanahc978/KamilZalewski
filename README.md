### Projects

##### Web apps: <div/>
As for now I finshed a few courses
and I'm really looking forward to do my own projects soon.


##### Other: <div/>
I've been also playing with JavaSE and even did a couple of projects:

<strong>Socket based communication app</strong><br/>
Very first "bigger" app that I've written. <br/>
Uses basic client-server architecture. <br/>

<strong>3D game(never likely to be finished ðŸ˜…)</strong> </br>
My attempt to make 3D game using no game engine(apart from what I've written). <br/>
Never really finished this project due to other commitments. <br/>
From this project I jumped straight to web technologies(no regrets so far). <br/>
